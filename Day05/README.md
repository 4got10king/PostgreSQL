## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D05_01](misc/images/D05_01.png)

How does indexing speed us up? Why does the same SQL query with and without index have different TPS (Transaction Per Second)? Actually, from “user-point-of-view”, index is just a “black box” with magic inside. From “mathematical-point-of-view”, index is just an organized structure and no magic at all. 

Let me explain the reason why index exists but is not used.

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
|Please take a look at the image, the red line means linear time to find data based on a query. In other words, if you need to find something, then you have to look in each block, page, tuple and create a list of your search rows. (This term has a name "sequential scanning"). Actually, if you created a BTree index, then you got an improvement for speed. So the green line corresponds to logarithmic search time. Let's imagine, if you have 1000000 rows, and to do a search for 1 row, you need, say... 1 second, then in total you need 1000000 seconds, but with index you need ln(1000000) ~ 14 seconds. | ![D05_02](misc/images/D05_02.png) |
| ![D05_03](misc/images/D05_03.png) | But why... does the index not work? There are several reasons to be honest, but the main one is based on the total number of rows of the indexed table. Please take a look at a picture, I have drawn a bold blue line and this is a path for search algorithms. As you can see, linear time at the beginning is most appropriate for algorithms instead of using logarithmic search. How do you find this intersection? Basically, I can recommend experiments, benchmarks, and ... your intuition. No formulas at all. Therefore, if you want to compare the results of your searches, you sometimes have to explicitly disable sequential scanning. For example, there is a special command set enable_seqscan =off in PostgreSQL. |




## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as your only reference. Do not listen to rumors and speculations about how to prepare your solution.
- Make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- It is perfectly fine if you use the IDE to write source code (aka SQL script).
- To be evaluated, your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your peers.
- You should not leave any files in your directory other than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Got a question? Ask your neighbor to the right. Otherwise, try your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. You may need things not specified in the topic.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
Absolutely anything can be represented in SQL! Let's get started and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have your own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). **Our knowledge way is incremental and linear therefore please be aware all changes that you made in Day03 during exercises 07-13 should be on place (its similar like in real world , when we applied a release and need to be consistency with data for new changes).**
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model. 

![schema](misc/images/schema.png)


1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

People's visit and people's order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a customer can be in a restaurant (just looking at the menu) and in that time place an order in another restaurant by phone or mobile application. Or another case, just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

## Chapter IV
## Exercise 00 - Let’s create indexes for every foreign key

| Exercise 00: Let’s create indexes for every foreign key |                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Turn-in directory                     | ex00                                                                                                                     |
| Files to turn-in                      | `day05_ex00.sql`                                                                                 |
| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |
| Language                        | ANSI SQL                                                                                              |

Please create a simple BTree index for each foreign key in our database. The name pattern should match the next rule "idx_{table_name}_{column_name}". For example, the name of the BTree index for the pizzeria_id column in the `menu` table is `idx_menu_pizzeria_id`.


## Chapter V
## Exercise 01 - How to see that index works?

| Exercise 01: How to see that index works?|                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Turn-in directory                     | ex01                                                                                                                     |
| Files to turn-in                      | `day05_ex01.sql`                                                                                 |
| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |
| Language                        | ANSI SQL                                                                                              |

Before proceeding, please write an SQL statement that returns pizzas and the corresponding pizzeria names. See the example result below (no sorting required).

| pizza_name | pizzeria_name | 
| ------ | ------ |
| cheese pizza | Pizza Hut |
| ... | ... |

Let's prove that your indexes work for your SQL.
The sample proof is the output of the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command. 
Please take a look at the sample output of the command.
    
    ...
    ->  Index Scan using idx_menu_pizzeria_id on menu m  (...)
    ...

**Hint**: Please think about why your indexes do not work in a direct way and what should we do to enable it?

Please create a functional B-Tree index  named `idx_person_name` on the column name of the `person` table. The index should contain person names in upper case. 

Write and provide any SQL with proof (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) that index idx_person_name works.

Please create a better multi-column B-Tree index named `idx_person_order_multi` for the SQL statement below.

    SELECT person_id, menu_id,order_date
    FROM person_order
    WHERE person_id = 8 AND menu_id = 19;


The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command should return the next pattern. Please pay attention to "Index Only Scan" scanning!

    Index Only Scan using idx_person_order_multi on person_order ...

Provide any SQL with proof (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) that index `idx_person_order_multi` works.

Take a look at the SQL below from a technical perspective (ignore a logical case of this SQL statement).

    SELECT
        m.pizza_name AS pizza_name,
        max(rating) OVER (PARTITION BY rating ORDER BY rating ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS k
    FROM  menu m
    INNER JOIN pizzeria pz ON m.pizzeria_id = pz.id
    ORDER BY 1,2;

Create a new BTree index named `idx_1` that should improve the "Execution Time" metric of this SQL. Provide evidence (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) that the SQL has been improved.

**Hint**: This exercise looks like a "brute force" task to find a good cover index, so before your new test, remove the `idx_1` index.

Sample of my improvement:

**Before**:

    Sort  (cost=26.08..26.13 rows=19 width=53) (actual time=0.247..0.254 rows=19 loops=1)

    Sort Method: quicksort  Memory: 26kB
    ->  WindowAgg  (cost=25.30..25.68 rows=19 width=53) (actual time=0.110..0.182 rows=19 loops=1)
            ->  Sort  (cost=25.30..25.35 rows=19 width=21) (actual time=0.088..0.096 rows=19 loops=1)
