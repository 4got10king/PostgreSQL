## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D06_01](misc/images/D06_01.png)

Why is a diamond one of the most durable objects? The reason lies in its structure. Each atom knows its place in the topology of the diamond and makes the whole diamond unbreakable. 

A logical structure is like a diamond. If you find a suitable structure for your own Database Model, you will find gold (or diamond :-). There are two aspects to Database Modeling. The first is a logical view, in other words, how your model will smoothly describe the real business world.

![D06_02](misc/images/D06_02.png)

On the other hand, your model should solve your functional tasks with minimal impact. This means transforming the logical model view into the physical model view, and not just from table and attribute descriptions. But actually, from performance and budget perspectives, which are more important today. How to find a balance? For this case, there are 3 steps to create a very good design. Just take a look at the image below.

## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as your only reference. Do not listen to rumors and speculations about how to prepare your solution.
- Make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- It is perfectly fine if you use the IDE to write source code (aka SQL script).
- To be evaluated, your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your peers.
- You should not leave any files in your directory other than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Got a question? Ask your neighbor to the right. Otherwise, try your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. You may need things not specified in the topic.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
Absolutely anything can be represented in SQL! Let's get started and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have your own database and access to it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). **Our knowledge way is incremental and linear therefore please be aware that all changes you made in Day03 during Exercises 07-13 and in Day04 during Exercise 07 should be on place (its similar like in real world when we applied a release and need to be consistent with data for new changes).**
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please review this section before starting.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model. 

![schema](misc/images/schema.png)


1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

People's visit and people's order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a customer can be in a restaurant (just looking at the menu) and at the same time place an order in another restaurant by phone or mobile application. Or another case, just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

Let's add a new business feature to our data model.
Every person wants to see a personal discount and every business wants to be closer for customers.

Think about personal discounts for people from one side and pizza restaurants from the other. Need to create a new relational table (please set a name `person_discounts`) with the following rules.
- Set id attribute like a Primary Key (please have a look at id column in existing tables and choose the same data type).
- Set attributes person_id and pizzeria_id as foreign keys for corresponding tables (data types should be the same as for id columns in corresponding parent tables).
- Please set explicit names for foreign key constraints using the pattern fk_{table_name}_{column_name}, for example `fk_person_discounts_person_id`.
- Add a discount attribute to store a discount value in percent. Remember that the discount value can be a floating-point number (just use the `numeric` datatype). So please choose the appropriate datatype to cover this possibility.



## Chapter V
## Exercise 01 - Let’s set personal discounts

| Exercise 01: Let’s set personal discounts|                                                                                                                          |

| Files to turn-in                      | `day06_ex01.sql`                                                                                 |
| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |
| Language                        | SQL, DML, DDL                                                                                              |

Actually, we have created a structure to store our discounts and we are ready to go further and fill our `person_discounts` table with new records.

So, there is a table `person_order` which stores the history of a person's orders. Please write a DML statement (`INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...`) that makes inserts new records into the `person_discounts` table based on the following rules.
- Take aggregated state from person_id and pizzeria_id columns.
- Calculate personal discount value by the next pseudo code:

    `if “amount of orders” = 1 then
        “discount” = 10.5 
    else if “amount of orders” = 2 then 
        “discount” = 22
    else 
        “discount” = 30`

- To create a primary key for the person_discounts table, use the following SQL construct (this construct is from the WINDOW FUNCTION SQL section).
    
    `... ROW_NUMBER( ) OVER ( ) AS id ...`




## Chapter VI
## Exercise 02 - Let’s recalculate a history of orders

| Exercise 02: Let’s recalculate a history of orders|                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Turn-in directory                     | ex02                                                                                                                     |
| Files to turn-in                      | `day06_ex02.sql`                                                                                 |
| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |
| Language                        | SQL, DML, DDL                                                                                              |

Write a SQL statement that returns the orders with actual price and price with discount applied for each person in the corresponding pizzeria restaurant, sorted by person name and pizza name. Please see the sample data below.

| name | pizza_name | price | discount_price | pizzeria_name | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Andrey | cheese pizza | 800 | 624 | Dominos |
| Andrey | mushroom pizza | 1100 | 858 | Dominos |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

| Files to turn-in                      | `day06_ex03.sql`                                                                                 |
| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |

Actually, we need to improve data consistency from one side and performance tuning from the other side. Please create a multi-column unique index (named `idx_person_discounts_unique`) that prevents duplicates of the person and pizzeria identifier pairs.

After creating a new index, please provide any simple SQL statement that shows proof of the index usage (using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`).
The proof example is below:
    
    ...
    Index Scan using idx_person_discounts_unique on person_discounts
    ...

Please add the following constraint rules for existing columns of the `person_discounts` table.
- person_id column should not be NULL (use constraint name `ch_nn_person_id`);
- pizzeria_id column should not be NULL (use constraint name `ch_nn_pizzeria_id`);
- discount column should not be NULL (use constraint name `ch_nn_discount`);
- discount column should be 0 percent by default;
- discount column should be in a range values from 0 to 100 (use constraint name `ch_range_discount`).

Let’s create a Database Sequence named `seq_person_discounts` (starting with a value of 1) and set a default value for the id attribute of the `person_discounts` table to automatically take a value from `seq_person_discounts` each time. 
Please note that your next sequence number is 1, in this case please set an actual value for database sequence based on formula "number of rows in person_discounts table" + 1. Otherwise you will get errors about Primary Key violation constraint.
